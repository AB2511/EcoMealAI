Create a `.env` file in your project root:
```env
CLIMATIQ_API_KEY=your_actual_climatiq_api_key
THEMEALDB_API_KEY=your_themealdb_api_key  # Optional
```

#### Option 2: System Environment Variables
Set environment variables in your system:

**Windows:**
```cmd
set CLIMATIQ_API_KEY=your_actual_climatiq_api_key
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
export CLIMATIQ_API_KEY=your_actual_climatiq_api_key
```

#### Option 3: Streamlit Secrets (for deployment)
For Streamlit Cloud deployment, add secrets in your Streamlit dashboard:
```toml
# .streamlit/secrets.toml
CLIMATIQ_API_KEY = "your_actual_climatiq_api_key"
THEMEALDB_API_KEY = "your_themealdb_api_key"
```

### Security Notes

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on optimizing OCR preprocessing capabilities and implementing a spec-to-code workflow for UI refinement in the EcoMealAI application. The goal is to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the fridge scanner's ingredient detection while improving the overall user interface experience through systematic UI refinements. All existing core functionality including TheMealDB API integration, carbon footprint calculations, ML recommendations, and Streamlit UI components must be preserved and enhanced.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced OCR Preprocessing Pipeline

**User Story:** As a user scanning fridge contents, I want improved ingredient detection accuracy from photos, so that I can get more reliable recipe recommendations based on my available ingredients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an image THEN the system SHALL apply advanced preprocessing techniques including adaptive thresholding, noise reduction, and contrast enhancement
2. WHEN OCR preprocessing is applied THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 85% accuracy improvement over current basic preprocessing
3. WHEN multiple OCR strategies fail THEN the system SHALL provide intelligent fallback options with clear user guidance
4. WHEN preprocessing is complete THEN the system SHALL display confidence scores for detected ingredients
5. IF an image has poor quality THEN the system SHALL provide specific feedback on how to improve the image

### Requirement 2: Intelligent OCR Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user experiencing OCR failures, I want clear guidance and alternative options, so that I can still use the fridge scanner feature effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OCR fails to detect text THEN the system SHALL provide specific troubleshooting suggestions based on the failure type
2. WHEN ingredient confidence is below threshold THEN the system SHALL allow manual verification and correction
3. WHEN no ingredients are detected THEN the system SHALL offer guided manual input with autocomplete suggestions
4. WHEN OCR libraries are missing THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to manual input mode with clear installation instructions
5. IF preprocessing fails THEN the system SHALL attempt alternative preprocessing strategies before failing

### Requirement 3: Spec-to-Code UI Refinement System

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the EcoMealAI interface, I want a systematic approach to UI improvements, so that I can efficiently implement consistent and user-friendly interface enhancements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UI refinements are needed THEN the system SHALL provide a structured specification process for defining improvements
2. WHEN specifications are created THEN the system SHALL generate actionable implementation tasks for UI components
3. WHEN UI changes are implemented THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing functionality and data flows
4. WHEN refinements are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design across all device sizes
5. IF conflicts arise during implementation THEN the system SHALL prioritize core functionality preservation

### Requirement 4: Advanced Image Quality Assessment

**User Story:** As a user taking photos for ingredient scanning, I want real-time feedback on image quality, so that I can capture optimal images for better OCR results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an image THEN the system SHALL analyze image quality metrics including brightness, contrast, and sharpness
2. WHEN image quality is suboptimal THEN the system SHALL provide specific improvement recommendations
3. WHEN multiple images are processed THEN the system SHALL learn and suggest optimal capture conditions
4. WHEN quality assessment is complete THEN the system SHALL display a quality score with actionable feedback
5. IF image quality is too poor THEN the system SHALL recommend retaking the photo with specific guidance

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Ingredient Matching and Validation

**User Story:** As a user reviewing detected ingredients, I want to verify and correct OCR results easily, so that my recipe recommendations are based on accurate ingredient lists.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ingredients are detected THEN the system SHALL display them with confidence scores and allow individual verification
2. WHEN a user corrects an ingredient THEN the system SHALL learn from the correction to improve future detections
3. WHEN ingredient names are ambiguous THEN the system SHALL provide disambiguation options with visual cues
4. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL update the ingredient database with verified entries
5. IF an ingredient is not recognized THEN the system SHALL allow custom ingredient addition with carbon footprint estimation

### Requirement 6: Streamlined UI Component Architecture

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the EcoMealAI interface, I want a more intuitive and responsive user experience, so that I can efficiently plan sustainable meals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UI components are rendered THEN the system SHALL use consistent design patterns and styling across all features
2. WHEN users navigate between features THEN the system SHALL maintain state and provide smooth transitions
3. WHEN forms are submitted THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and validation messages
4. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL display appropriate progress indicators and status updates
5. IF errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with recovery options

### Requirement 7: Performance Optimization for OCR Operations

**User Story:** As a user processing multiple images, I want fast and efficient OCR processing, so that I can quickly scan my fridge contents without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OCR processing begins THEN the system SHALL complete preprocessing within 3 seconds for standard images
2. WHEN multiple OCR strategies are used THEN the system SHALL process them efficiently with progress tracking
3. WHEN large images are uploaded THEN the system SHALL automatically optimize them for processing speed
4. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL cache results to avoid reprocessing identical images
5. IF processing takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates and estimated completion time

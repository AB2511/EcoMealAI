# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical UI/UX issues in the meal planning application including deprecated Streamlit parameters, interface separation concerns, and functionality improvements for recipe management and weekly plan generation. The goal is to improve user experience by fixing technical issues, enhancing recipe interaction capabilities, and creating proper interface separation between different application components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Deprecated Streamlit Parameters

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the application, I want to update deprecated Streamlit parameters, so that the application remains compatible with current and future Streamlit versions without warnings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying recipe images THEN the system SHALL use `use_container_width` parameter instead of deprecated `use_column_width`
2. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL NOT display any deprecation warnings related to Streamlit parameters
3. WHEN images are displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain the same visual layout and responsiveness as before

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Recipe Management

**User Story:** As a user browsing recipe recommendations, I want to save recipes and add them to my meal plan, so that I can build a personalized collection and easily incorporate favorite recipes into my weekly planning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing recipe recommendations THEN the system SHALL display functional "Save Recipe" and "Add to Plan" buttons for each recipe
2. WHEN a user clicks "Save Recipe" THEN the system SHALL store the recipe in a user's saved recipes collection
3. WHEN a user clicks "Add to Plan" THEN the system SHALL allow the user to select which day and meal slot to add the recipe to
4. WHEN recipes are saved THEN the system SHALL provide a way to view and manage the saved recipes collection
5. WHEN adding recipes to plan THEN the system SHALL update the weekly plan display immediately

### Requirement 3: Improved Weekly Plan Generation

**User Story:** As a user creating meal plans, I want reliable weekly plan generation, so that I can consistently create complete meal plans that meet my dietary preferences and constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a weekly plan THEN the system SHALL successfully create plans for all requested days and meals
2. WHEN plan generation fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages explaining the issue
3. WHEN plans are generated THEN the system SHALL validate that all meals meet the specified dietary restrictions and constraints
4. WHEN displaying generated plans THEN the system SHALL show complete recipe information including ingredients, prep time, and carbon footprint
5. WHEN regenerating plans THEN the system SHALL allow users to keep specific meals while regenerating others

### Requirement 4: Separate Interface Components

**User Story:** As a user navigating the application, I want the dashboard and shopping list to open in separate interfaces from the weekly meal plan, so that I can access different features without interface conflicts and have a cleaner user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the gamification dashboard THEN the system SHALL display it in a dedicated interface separate from the meal planning view
2. WHEN opening the shopping list THEN the system SHALL display it in a dedicated interface separate from the meal planning view
3. WHEN switching between interfaces THEN the system SHALL provide clear navigation options to move between meal planning, dashboard, and shopping list views
4. WHEN in any interface THEN the system SHALL maintain the current state of other interfaces when switching between them
5. WHEN closing an interface THEN the system SHALL return to an appropriate default view without losing user data

### Requirement 5: Enhanced User Interface Navigation

**User Story:** As a user of the meal planning application, I want intuitive navigation between different features, so that I can efficiently access meal planning, progress tracking, and shopping functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the application THEN the system SHALL provide a clear main navigation menu or sidebar for accessing different features
2. WHEN in any feature area THEN the system SHALL display breadcrumbs or clear indicators of the current location
3. WHEN switching features THEN the system SHALL preserve user input and selections where appropriate
4. WHEN returning to previously visited features THEN the system SHALL restore the previous state and data
5. WHEN using mobile or smaller screens THEN the system SHALL maintain usable navigation and interface elements

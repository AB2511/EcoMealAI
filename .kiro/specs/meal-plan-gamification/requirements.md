# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature replaces the existing Fridge Inventory Scanner with a comprehensive Weekly Meal Plan Generator and Carbon Footprint Gamification Dashboard. The goal is to provide users with automated weekly meal planning capabilities while gamifying their carbon footprint reduction journey through achievements, streaks, and progress tracking. All existing core functionality including TheMealDB API integration, carbon footprint calculations, ML recommendations, and Streamlit UI components must be preserved and enhanced.
